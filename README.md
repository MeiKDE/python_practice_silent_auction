Silent Auction Program
This is a simple console-based auction program where multiple users can place bids, and the highest bidder is declared the winner. The program clears the screen after each bid to maintain anonymity, and after all bids are placed, it announces the highest bidder.

Features
Anonymous Bidding: Clears the console after each bid using a cross-platform clear() function.
Multiple Bidders: Allows users to place bids repeatedly until they indicate they are finished.
Highest Bidder Announcement: The program finds and displays the highest bid once all bidding is completed.
How it Works
User Input:

Each user inputs their name and bid amount.
They are then asked if they want to continue bidding or not.
Finding the Winner:

Once all users finish bidding, the program determines and announces the highest bidder.
Clearing the Console:

After each bid, the screen is cleared to ensure no one can see the previous bids, maintaining privacy.
Ending the Auction:

The auction ends when users input 'n' for no further bidding, and the winner is revealed.
How to Run
Run the program in any Python environment.
Follow the prompts to enter your name, bid, and whether you'd like to continue.
The highest bidder will be announced once all bids are placed.
